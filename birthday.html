         I want you to be with me forever,doesn't matter how we met or how late we met it's just that some people are so close to us that all we pray is
         " I NEED THAT PERSON TO BE WITH ME FOREVER" 
         I do the same when i think about you because it's a beautiful feeling when someone like you who actually knows me better.
    </div>
    <div class="det1">
      Once you were a stranger to me but now you are my fav person,a person closet to my heart,a person whom i actually love to talk to whole day
      you have always made me feel special in everyway,from those little fights,those little conversations to have laughs and memories we can never 
      forget you have become so important to me.
   </div>
   <div class="det2">
       I always  want to be your side,and its difficult to me without you.Thankyou for being with me and for joining me on this journey through life.Your love is evrything to me.
